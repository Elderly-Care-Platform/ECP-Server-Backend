		We are a community of people who care about ageing and elder care.
		Here we share experiences of caregiving - and of being taken care of;
		share pain and love, despair and hope. Here you can get answers,
		encouragement, and support from people like you, in a situation like
		yours.<br />
		<br /> This is the place to make informed decisions about <a href="">caregivers
			and doctors</a>, as well as <a href="">services</a> for seniors, and <a
			href="">senior living facilities</a>, reviewed by our community.<br />
		<br /> This is also a place to purchase a variety of <a href="">products</a>
		that make ageing so much more comfortable. And to learn about ageing
		and healthcare <a href="">breakthroughs</a>, and local <a href="">news</a>.<br />
		<br /> A place to find new opportunities, new on-line friends, and
		companions. To have a good time together, engaging in various hobbies
		and activities.<br />
		<br /> And to <a href="">celebrate lives</a> well lived. <br />
		<br /> We are the best reason for your parents to get a tablet.<br />
		<br /> May all elderly people and their loving families enjoy
		beautiful years together.<br />

				India is one of the best places in the world to age gracefully, as
				the young have always looked after the old.<br />
				<br> Yet, ageing in India has its challenges:<br />
				<br>

				<ul class="text-left">
					<li>The issues of ageing are not acknowledged enough; elder's
						needs are often ignored or misunderstood.</li>
					<li>A lack of information and of professional support leaves
						families to deal with issues of ageing on their own.</li>
					<li>Younger people find jobs in other places - in India and
						overseas. So more and more seniors find themselves living alone.</li>
				</ul>
				<br /> Older people are undergoing a change too; the new generation
				of "young seniors" don't want their kids to sacrifice their careers
				in order to take care of them; they are keen on being independent,
				and living with dignity. They would like their retirement years to
				be an age of active contribution.<br />
				<br> Today, the definition of the term 'old' is different - we
				are not "old" even at 75!<br />
				<br> Hence, BeautifulYears.com<br />
